2048 Machine Learning
=====================

This is a project on machine learning. A player script will attempt to solve the [2048 puzzle](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048).
TKinter was used for the graphics engine, I will be implementing [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) for the machine learning side
